I’m Juan Sebastián Carrillo, a Ph.D. student in Computational Science through a joint program between **San Diego State University (SDSU)** and the **University of California, Irvine (UCI)**. Under the guidance of **Dr. Jérôme Gilles**, I explore the intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning, and image processing — with a particular focus on real-world problems like medical diagnostics and image degradation due to turbulence.

The structure of my program allows me to spend the first academic year at SDSU and the second at UCI, after which I’ll decide whether to remain at UCI or return to SDSU to complete the research phase of the doctorate.

My academic foundation began in Colombia, where I earned both my **Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Systems Engineering** at Universidad Industrial de Santander. During my Master’s, I focused on the **automatic detection of glaucoma from fundus images**, culminating in a publication at the **IEEE STSIVA 2019** conference. That experience sparked my passion for biomedical applications of AI and led to the development of novel segmentation techniques that achieved over **88% detection accuracy** in collaboration with the Center for Glaucoma Prevention and Care in Bucaramanga.

### Research & Teaching

My current research includes building neural architectures to mitigate distortions such as blur and tilt in optical imaging — a critical challenge in remote sensing, astronomy, and long-distance surveillance systems. I use tools like **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **MATLAB**, and have experience with parallel programming in C, object-oriented design, and low-level Unix-based environments.

In addition to research, I have an active role in teaching. At SDSU, I was funded through the **Center for Research in Mathematics and Computational Science (CSRC)** and served as a **Teaching Assistant for Calculus I**. At UCI, I TA’d for **CS146 (Unix)** — a technical, command-line focused course taught by Prof. Wayne Hayes — and also supported a **graduate-level Capstone course** where I assisted students in developing and delivering effective scientific communications, reports, and presentations. I enjoy mentoring and believe teaching is one of the best ways to reinforce understanding and inspire future researchers.

### Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Python, C, MATLAB, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, SQL  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: PyTorch, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy  
- **Tools**: Git, Unix/Linux, Bash, OpenLab  
- **Focus Areas**: Image processing, neural networks, machine learning, computational optics

### Vision

My long-term goal is to **work in research and development within industry**, particularly in fields where advanced algorithms can directly impact human well-being — such as medical imaging, autonomous systems, and vision-based diagnostics. I’m driven by the potential to translate theoretical models into practical solutions that solve real-world problems.

### Outside the Lab

When I’m not working on models or helping students debug code, I explore other passions that keep me grounded and inspired. I’m a fan of **naked and multipurpose motorcycles**, often taking time to ride and disconnect from screens. I also enjoy **photography** — especially capturing urban moments and textures — and I’m always discovering **new music**. My playlists adapt to my mood and range from smooth instrumentals to high-energy Latin rhythms. I also enjoy dancing — it's one of my favorite ways to unwind and recharge.

This mix of analytical work and creative expression keeps me balanced and motivated on my journey as a scientist and educator.
